Given an array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

Return the indices of the two numbers (1-indexed) as an integer array answer of size 2, where 1 <= answer[0] < answer[1] <= numbers.length.

The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.

字典方法效率最高

### 1. 双指针
因为数组是已经排好序的，所以可以通过双指针左右移动

```
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        leftpoint, rightpoint = 0, len(numbers)-1
        
        while (leftpoint < rightpoint):
            
            if (numbers[leftpoint] + numbers[rightpoint] > target):
                
                rightpoint -= 1
                continue
            
            if (numbers[leftpoint] + numbers[rightpoint] < target):
                leftpoint += 1
                continue
                
            if (numbers[leftpoint] + numbers[rightpoint] == target):
                return [leftpoint+1,rightpoint+1]
```
				
			
### 2. 字典
```
class Solution:`
    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        
        dic = {}
        
        for i in range(len(numbers)):
            
            if target - numbers[i] in dic.keys():
                return (dic.get(target -numbers[i])+1, i+1)
            dic[numbers[i]] = i
